Description:
This C++ program, named PA4.cpp, is exercises Object-Oriented concepts by inheriting Employee class by Manager class and calculates the highest paid manager with the average pay of all employees. We assume the maximum number of managers
we can input is 100 and create the array of size 100. The program dynamically allocates an array of Manager objects based on user input to calculate and display the highest-paid manager and the average pay among them. The files 
included are as follows:
1. PA4.cpp: This is the main source code file that calculates the highest paid manager and average pay for the program.
2. Employee.h: This is the header file containing the class declaration for the Employee class, which is inherited by the Manager class.
3. Employee.cpp: This is the implementation file of the Employyee class.
